# 🏙️ AI + Drone-Based Property Tax Assessment System

Accurate property tax assessment is critical for effective urban governance and municipal revenue collection. This project proposes an AI-driven, drone-enabled solution to automate the detection of underreported or unauthorized building floors to ensure fair taxation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In many developing urban areas, property tax collection is hindered by outdated records and manual inspection limitations. This system addresses the issue through a **two-phase** approach:

### ✅ Phase 1: AI-Based Tax Record Validation
- Analyzes municipal property tax databases.
- Detects anomalies where recorded building heights don't match tax amounts.
- Uses machine learning models for anomaly detection and pattern analysis.

### 🚁 Phase 2: Drone + LiDAR Integration
- Uses drones equipped with LiDAR or similar height-detection sensors.
- Captures accurate building height data in real-time.
- Compares drone data with official records to flag unauthorized constructions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect inconsistencies between municipal tax data and actual building specs.
- Identify unauthorized floor additions using drone-captured height data.
- Automate verification to reduce manual workload and improve accuracy.
- Boost municipal revenue by minimizing tax evasion.
- Enable fair taxation and informed urban planning.

## 💡 Motivation

1. **Prevent Revenue Loss**: Address widespread tax evasion due to misreporting.
2. **Improve Efficiency**: Replace slow, error-prone manual processes.
3. **Support Urban Growth**: Provide data for sustainable planning and equitable taxation.
